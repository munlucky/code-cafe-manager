Read the agreement and similar features, then confirm the change scope.\n2. List new vs modified files separately.\n3. Write the plan in phases: Mock -> API -> Verification (if needed).\n4. Document risks, dependencies, checkpoints, and verification items.\n5. Write the document following `context-template.md`.\n## Quality bar\n- Each step must be actionable (clear file paths/ownership).\n- Record any missing dependencies/questions.\n- Refer to `.claude/PROJECT.md` for project-specific rules."
